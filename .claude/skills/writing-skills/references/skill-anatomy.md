## Frontmatter Fields

All fields are defined at the top of SKILL.md between `---` markers.

### `name` (Required)

```yaml
name: flutter-mobile
```

- Matches the directory name exactly
- Lowercase, hyphenated
- Should be a specific domain, not generic ("api-patterns" is bad; "nestjs-api" is good)

### `description` (Required)

```yaml
description: Use when building Flutter screens...
```

- This is the PRIMARY trigger mechanism -- Claude selects skills by matching description
- Must include: what the skill does, when to use it, trigger words/phrases
- Minimum 2 sentences; up to 8 sentences is fine
- Include ALL synonyms a developer might type

### `allowed-tools` (Strongly Recommended)

```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
```

Available tool names:
- `Read` -- read file contents
- `Write` -- create/overwrite files
- `Edit` -- targeted string replacement in files
- `Glob` -- file pattern matching
- `Grep` -- content search (ripgrep)
- `Bash` -- shell command execution
- `Agent` -- spawn sub-agents (use sparingly)
- `WebFetch` -- fetch URL content
- `WebSearch` -- search the web

**Principle:** List the MINIMUM tools the skill needs. Do not grant Write/Edit if the skill is read-only (reviewers). Do not grant Bash if no shell commands are needed.

### `last-reviewed` (Recommended)

```yaml
last-reviewed: "2026-03-14"
```

- ISO-8601 date of last substantive review (content verified against current docs/APIs)
- Updated whenever the skill body or references are meaningfully revised
- Used by `/audit-skills` to flag skills not reviewed in 90+ days
- Do NOT update just for typo fixes — only when content correctness was verified

### `metadata` (Optional)

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  domain: "backend"
  stack: "java"
```

Arbitrary key-value store. Use for tagging, versioning, or domain classification.

## Progressive Disclosure Rules

| Content Type | Where to Put It |
|-------------|----------------|
| Iron Laws | SKILL.md body (always visible) |
| Decision trees | SKILL.md body |
| Quick checklists | SKILL.md body |
| Stack-specific code examples | references/ |
| Long pattern catalogs | references/ |
| Review checklists (for agents) | references/ |
| Diagrams | assets/ |
| Setup scripts | scripts/ |

## File Size Limits

| File | Limit | Action if Exceeded |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| SKILL.md (body) | 500 lines | Move examples to references/ |
| references/*.md | 300 lines | Split into topic-specific files |
| Total skill directory | No hard limit | Keep lean -- context is precious |

## Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Skill directory | lowercase-hyphenated | `nestjs-api` |
| Reference files | descriptive-hyphenated | `reactive-patterns.md` |
| Review checklists | `*-review-checklist.md` | `spring-reactive-review-checklist.md` |
| Stack patterns | `patterns-<stack>.md` | `patterns-java.md` |
