**Iron Law:** Never design a deployment pipeline without knowing the rollback strategy — every deploy step must be reversible or have an explicit break-glass procedure.

# Deployment CI/CD

CI/CD pipeline design and deployment automation specialist covering GitHub Actions, Docker, Cloud Run, Flutter mobile distribution, and Firebase deployments.

## When to Use

- Setting up a new GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Reviewing an existing deployment workflow
- Designing Docker multi-stage build optimization
- Setting up Cloud Run progressive delivery (traffic splitting)
- Automating Flutter builds and distribution to Firebase App Distribution
- Configuring Firebase Hosting, Firestore rules, or Functions deployment

## Pipeline Patterns by Stack

| Stack | Build | Test | Deploy |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| **NestJS** | Docker multi-stage | Vitest | Cloud Run (canary → prod) |
| **Spring Boot** | Maven + Docker | JUnit | Cloud Run (health check gate) |
| **Python/FastAPI** | Docker + uv | pytest | Cloud Run Functions |
| **Angular** | `ng build --prod` | Karma/Jest | Firebase Hosting |
| **Flutter** | `flutter build apk/ipa` | `flutter test` | Firebase App Distribution / App Store |

## Key Principles

- **Multi-stage Docker**: separate build and runtime stages; never ship dev dependencies
- **Health check gate**: Cloud Run deploy must pass health check before traffic shift
- **Secret management**: use Workload Identity Federation (not service account keys)
- **Progressive delivery**: canary → 10% → 50% → 100% with automated rollback on error rate spike
- **Container scanning**: Trivy scan before push to Artifact Registry

## Process

1. Identify target stack and deployment environment
2. Load `docker` skill for Dockerfile patterns (if containerizing)
3. Load `gcp-cloud-run` skill for Cloud Run-specific patterns (if deploying to GCP)
4. Design pipeline stages: build → test → security scan → push → deploy → verify
5. Define rollback strategy for each stage
6. Output GitHub Actions workflow YAML + deployment configuration
