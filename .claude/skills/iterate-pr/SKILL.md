**Iron Law:** Never mark a PR iteration complete without all CI checks passing; always show actual CI output as evidence, not inference.

# Iterate PR Until CI Passes

Autonomously fixes CI failures and addresses review feedback in a loop until all checks are green and feedback is resolved.

**Requires:** GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated, Python `uv` installed.

## Quick Reference

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/fetch_pr_checks.py [--pr NUMBER]
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/fetch_pr_feedback.py [--pr NUMBER]
```

## Workflow Summary (8 Steps)

1. Identify PR (`gh pr view`)
2. Gather review feedback (`fetch_pr_feedback.py`)
3. Handle feedback by LOGAF priority — auto-fix high/medium, ask for low
4. Check CI status (`fetch_pr_checks.py`)
5. Fix CI failures — read logs, trace root cause, fix, run tests
6. Verify locally, commit, push
7. Monitor CI in a poll loop — address new feedback as it arrives
8. Repeat from Step 2 if new feedback required changes

## Circuit Breaker — 6-Cycle Limit

Track the number of full fix→push→CI cycles completed. **After 6 cycles without reaching exit conditions, stop and escalate.**

A "cycle" = one complete pass through Steps 2–8 (gather feedback → fix → push → CI result).

**On hitting cycle 6 with no resolution:**
```
ESCALATION — Cycle limit reached (6/6)

What was attempted:
- Cycle 1: [what was fixed, what CI returned]
- Cycle 2: [what was fixed, what CI returned]
- Cycle 3: [what was fixed, what CI returned]
- Cycle 4: [what was fixed, what CI returned]
- Cycle 5: [what was fixed, what CI returned]
- Cycle 6: [what was fixed, what CI returned]

Still failing:
- [check name]: [error description] — [log snippet or file:line]

Options:
A) Provide direction on the specific failure above
B) Approve the PR with known failures (describe what to accept)
C) Close the PR and start fresh with a different approach
→ Which do you prefer?
```

Do NOT attempt a 7th cycle. Do NOT make any more code changes. Wait for human direction.

## LOGAF Scale

| Level | Labels | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `high` | `h:`, blocker, changes requested | Auto-fix |
| `medium` | `m:`, standard feedback | Auto-fix |
| `low` | `l:`, nit, style, suggestion | Ask user |
| `bot` | Codecov, Dependabot informational | Skip |
| `resolved` | Already resolved threads | Skip |

Review bot feedback (`review_bot: true`) in high/medium/low — treat as human feedback.
