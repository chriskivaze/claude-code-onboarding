# Code Standards

## Documentation Before Code

Consult official docs via MCP before writing ANY code. This rule is enforced here (always-loaded) because CLAUDE.md is not visible to sub-agents.

```
About to write code?
    |
    +-- Does a dedicated MCP server exist for this library/framework?
    |   YES -> Query it first. Use the response to inform your implementation.
    |   NO  -> Use Context7 MCP as fallback.
    |
    +-- Does the code use an API you haven't verified this session?
    |   YES -> Check signature, params, return type against MCP/docs before using.
    |   NO  -> Continue.
    |
    +-- Does this change touch the database (schema, queries, migrations)?
    |   YES -> Follow postgres-best-practices. Run `postgresql-database-reviewer` agent.
    |   NO  -> Continue.
    |
    +-- Is this the simplest correct solution?
        NO  -> Simplify before proceeding. Re-read core-behaviors.md §4.
        YES -> Proceed.
```

**Non-negotiable:**
- NEVER generate code from memory when an MCP server can confirm the current API
- NEVER use deprecated methods — MCP results will show current alternatives
- If MCP returns something different from what you expected, trust the MCP result

**Dependency version selection:**
- When selecting a dependency, explicitly use the latest stable version. Pin to a specific version in `package.json` / `pubspec.yaml` / `pom.xml` / `pyproject.toml` — never use `*`, `latest`, or unpinned ranges in production.
- Verify the package exists and is legitimate before installing (see `security-review-checklist.md` §6 Dependencies).

**MCP lookup order:**
1. Dedicated MCP server listed in the skill's SKILL.md (e.g., Vite MCP, Firebase MCP, Dart MCP)
2. `Context7` MCP — resolve library ID first, then query docs
3. `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` — last resort for very new or niche libraries

## Modify Existing Files First

```
Need to add code?
    ↓
Does relevant file exist?
    ├─ YES → Modify existing file (DEFAULT)
    └─ NO → Is this >150–200 lines of cohesive new logic?
              ├─ YES → Consider new file (ask human first)
              └─ NO → Find closest existing file and add there
```

When creating new files: remove/update old files, update all imports, delete orphans. NEVER leave old + new both existing.

## Error Handling

### No Silent Failures, No Mock Data, No Fallbacks

```
// ❌ FORBIDDEN (applies to ALL languages)
catch (e) { return []; }           // Silent empty return
catch (e) { return MockData.x; }   // Fake data
catch (e) { /* nothing */ }        // Swallowed exception

// ✅ REQUIRED
catch (e) {
  logger.error('fetchData failed', error: e);
  rethrow; // OR return error state (Result.failure, HttpException, HTTPException, etc.)
}
```

- Every catch block MUST log the error
- Every catch block MUST either rethrow OR return an error state
- User MUST see when something fails (snackbar, error widget, toast, etc.)
- NEVER return empty list/null/default on error
- NEVER create mock data unless explicitly requested
- Language-specific patterns: see each technology's skill (e.g., `vue-tailwind-spa`, `nestjs-api`, `express-api`, `laravel-inertia`, `python-dev`, `flutter-mobile`)

## DRY Enforcement

Before writing ANY code:

1. CHECK: Does this logic exist in shared/common utilities? → YES: import it
2. ASK: Will another module need this? → YES: create in shared utilities first

**Forbidden:** inline utility logic when shared version exists; duplicating logic across files.

| Metric | Target | Action |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| File size | ~400–500 lines | Extract when hard to navigate |
| Duplicate code blocks | 0 | Extract to shared |
| Inline utilities | 0 | Move to shared |

### Rule of Three — Abstraction Threshold

Use this to decide WHEN to create a shared utility or abstraction:

| Occurrences | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| 1 use | Inline — no abstraction |
| 2 uses | Accept the duplication — abstracting now is premature |
| 3+ uses | Create a shared utility/service — abstraction is justified |

**Why:** Abstracting at 1-2 uses means guessing at the right interface. At 3 uses, the pattern is proven and the correct abstraction is usually obvious.

**Exception:** If a shared utility is already < 50 lines AND is used consistently across the codebase, extracting at 2 uses is acceptable — but not required.

**Code review check:** Before approving a new helper, service, or base class, ask: "Is this abstraction backed by 3+ actual use cases today?" If not, inline it.

## Logging Standards

- **Structured:** All logs include context (user type, action, timestamp)
- **Centralized:** Single logging utility used everywhere
- **Leveled:** Appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Log all error conditions with full context
- Log sync operations (start, success, failure)
- NEVER log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- NEVER use `print()` — use centralized logger
- NEVER use `console.log()` / `console.warn()` / `console.error()` directly — use centralized logger (e.g., NestJS `Logger`, Vue plugin-level error handler). Raw console statements leak internal logic to anyone with devtools open. Sweep before every deploy.

## Output Quality

- No bloated abstractions or premature generalization
- No clever tricks without comments explaining why
- Match the project's idioms — don't introduce a different paradigm mid-file
- Meaningful variable names (no `temp`, `data`, `result` without context)
- Zero: deprecated APIs, stub implementations, TODO comments, duplicate implementations, backward compatibility wrappers

## Change Descriptions

After any modification:

```
CHANGES MADE:
- [file]: [what changed and why]

THINGS I DIDN'T TOUCH:
- [file]: [intentionally left alone because...]

POTENTIAL CONCERNS:
- [any risks or things to verify]
```

## Content Validation Before Writing

Before creating or writing ANY file containing diagrams or structured content:

### Mermaid Diagrams
- Validate syntax mentally before writing — broken Mermaid renders as raw text
- Escape special characters: parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, quotes in node labels
- Test: Can every node label be parsed without ambiguity?
- Always provide a text description as fallback below the diagram block

### ASCII Diagrams
- Use ONLY these characters: `+` `-` `|` `^` `v` `<` `>` and spaces
- NEVER use Unicode box-drawing characters: `┌ ─ │ └ ┐ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼ ▼ ▲ ► ◄`
  (they render inconsistently across terminals and fonts)
- Every line inside a box MUST have the same character count
- Verify alignment in monospace before writing

### General
- No raw HTML in markdown files unless the render target is confirmed to support it
- No emoji in code comments or rule files unless the project explicitly uses them
- Special characters in file paths must be escaped per the target shell

## Performance

Never optimize without evidence. Profile first.

- Use DevTools (Chrome for Vue, Flutter DevTools for mobile) before assuming a bottleneck
- Follows the naive-then-optimize pattern: correct first, then profile, then optimize the proven bottleneck
- Quantify improvements: "Reduced load time from 1200ms to 400ms" not "made it faster"
- No premature optimization — measure before and after, or don't optimize
- Database queries: use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before rewriting. Verify index usage

## Security and Accessibility Baseline

These rules apply to ALL code changes — not just when a reviewer agent is dispatched.

### Security

- All API endpoints MUST validate and sanitize inputs
- Never trust client-side data — validate server-side
- No secrets, keys, or credentials in code — use environment variables
- Parameterized queries only — no string concatenation for SQL
- Encode output to prevent XSS (use framework defaults, never bypass)
- Authentication and authorization checks on every protected endpoint
- Passwords MUST be hashed (bcrypt cost>=12 or argon2) — never store or compare plaintext
- File uploads MUST be validated (type, size, content) and size-limited — never accept unbounded uploads

### Accessibility

- All UI changes must follow WCAG 2.1 AA baseline
- Semantic HTML (Vue) / proper widget semantics (Flutter)
- Interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable and screen-reader accessible
- Color contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for normal text, >= 3:1 for large text
- Touch targets >= 48dp (Flutter) / 44px (Vue)
