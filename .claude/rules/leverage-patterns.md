# Leverage Patterns

## Task Response Protocol

For every task:

```
1. UNDERSTAND: Restate the task. Flag ambiguity.
2. PLAN: 3-5 bullet approach before coding.
3. DECISIONS: List design choices and tradeoffs.
4. IMPLEMENT: Simplest correct solution.
5. VERIFY: Dead code, unused imports, unrelated changes, edge cases.
6. REPORT: What changed, what didn't, any concerns.
```

For small/obvious tasks, compress — but NEVER skip UNDERSTAND or VERIFY.

For non-trivial changes (architecture, multi-service, schema changes): use the `plan-mode-review` skill or `/plan-review` command, which extends this protocol with Phase 0 self-review, approval scope triage, and production readiness gates. Save the approved plan to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md` before starting implementation — this gives a persistent, git-committed reference for the session and future sessions.

## Declarative Over Imperative

Prefer success criteria over step-by-step commands:

> "I understand the goal is [success state]. I'll work toward that. Correct?"

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

## Test-First

When implementing new features or new logic (per CLAUDE.md: "Always write tests"):

1. Write the test that defines success
2. Implement until the test passes
3. Show both

For trivial changes (renaming, config tweaks, one-line fixes): run existing tests, don't write new ones unless behavior changed.

Tests are your loop condition.

## Naive Then Optimize

1. Implement the obviously-correct naive version first
2. Verify correctness
3. Then optimize while preserving behavior

Correctness first. Performance second. Never skip step 1.

### Three-Pass Development Pattern

For any non-trivial implementation, apply these passes in order. Each pass is independently testable and releasable before moving to the next.

**Pass 1 — Make it work**
- Write the simplest code that passes the tests
- Acceptable: verbose, repetitive, naive algorithms, hardcoded values
- Not acceptable: broken tests, silent failures
- Gate: all tests pass → commit

**Pass 2 — Make it clear**
- Rename variables to reflect intent
- Extract functions where logic is non-obvious (see Rule of Three before extracting)
- Remove dead code your changes created
- No behavior change — tests must still pass identically
- Gate: tests pass, diff is only naming/structure changes → commit

**Pass 3 — Make it efficient** (only if evidence demands it)
- Profile first — identify the actual bottleneck (DevTools / EXPLAIN ANALYZE / benchmarks)
- Optimize only the proven bottleneck
- Measure before and after: "Reduced X from Yms to Zms"
- Gate: tests pass, performance improvement measured → commit

**Rules:**
- Never skip to Pass 3 without completing Passes 1 and 2
- Never run Pass 3 without profiling evidence
- If human says "just ship it" — Pass 1 output is shippable. Stop there.
- For trivial changes (renaming, config tweaks): single pass is fine — don't over-process

## Browser MCP in the Loop

When applicable, use a browser MCP for real-time validation. Verify against actual rendered output or live behavior, not just static code analysis.

## Skill and Agent Selection

Skills and agents are lazy-loaded — load the right one before working in a domain. CLAUDE.md has the full mapping tables, but sub-agents don't see CLAUDE.md. This section provides the selection logic.

### When to Load a Skill

```
About to write or modify code?
    |
    +-- What technology? Match to skill:
    |   Vue.js/Tailwind -> vue-tailwind-spa
    |   NestJS          -> nestjs-api
    |   Express         -> express-api
    |   Laravel/PHP     -> laravel-inertia
    |   Python/FastAPI  -> python-dev
    |   Agentic AI      -> agentic-ai-dev
    |   Flutter         -> flutter-mobile
    |   Database schema -> database-schema-designer
    |   Architecture    -> architecture-design
    |
    +-- Cross-cutting concern?
        Debugging       -> systematic-debugging
        Security audit  -> load skill, then dispatch security-reviewer agent
        Code review     -> load skill, then dispatch tech-specific reviewer agent
        Browser testing -> browser-testing
        Plan review     -> plan-mode-review
```

**Rule:** Load the skill BEFORE writing code, not after. Skills contain patterns, templates, and MCP server references that prevent mistakes.

### Auto Mode Detection — Trigger Words → Behavior

When a request contains these trigger words, adopt the corresponding behavior automatically. No announcement needed — just behave accordingly.

| Trigger words in request | Mode | Behavior |
|--------------------------|------|----------|
| "what if", "options", "alternatives", "explore", "compare", "should we use", "which approach" | **BRAINSTORM** | Use `/brainstorm` — ≥3 options with trade-offs, Mermaid diagram, no code yet |
| "build", "create", "add", "implement", "write", "scaffold" | **IMPLEMENT** | Code only, max 2-sentence summary, no tutorial comments, no over-engineering (`core-behaviors.md §4`) |
| "not working", "error", "bug", "failing", "broken", "crash", "exception", "why does" | **DEBUG** | Use `/debug` — load `systematic-debugging`, root cause first, no fixes before investigation |
| "review", "check", "audit", "is this right", "look at" | **REVIEW** | Load tech-specific reviewer agent, severity-bucketed findings |
| "explain", "how does", "what is", "teach me", "help me understand" | **TEACH** | Fundamentals first, analogy, example, then technical detail |
| "deploy", "release", "ship", "production", "ready to merge" | **SHIP** | Run `/ship` — full pre-deploy gate across all stacks |

**Important:** These are defaults, not locks. If the request mixes signals (e.g. "explain then build"), acknowledge both and ask which to start with.

### When to Dispatch a Reviewer Agent

Reviewer agents are dispatched AFTER code is written, not before. Match by domain:

| Signal in Changed Files | Reviewer Agent |
|------------------------|----------------|
| `*.vue`, Pinia stores, Vue Router, Tailwind classes | `vue-reviewer` |
| `*.ts` with NestJS decorators (`@Controller`, `@Injectable`) | `nestjs-reviewer` |
| `*.ts` Express/Node route handlers, middleware | `node-backend-reviewer` |
| `*.php`, `routes/`, `app/Http/`, Eloquent models | `laravel-reviewer` |
| `*.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`, Riverpod providers | `riverpod-reviewer` |
| LangChain/LangGraph imports, agent graphs | `agentic-ai-reviewer` |
| SQL migrations, schema changes | `postgresql-database-reviewer` |
| Any security-sensitive change (auth, crypto, input handling) | `security-reviewer` |
| UI components, design tokens, accessibility | `ui-standards-expert` or `accessibility-auditor` |
| None of the above / mixed | `code-reviewer` (general) |

**Rule:** When in doubt, dispatch `code-reviewer`. It covers all languages. Stack-specific reviewers add deeper checks but are not a replacement — use both for critical changes.

### Common Mistakes

- Loading a skill after already writing code → patterns were missed, rewrite likely
- Dispatching a reviewer for the wrong stack → shallow review, false confidence
- Skipping skill load for "small changes" → small changes to Vue Composition API or NestJS still need the skill's patterns to avoid framework-specific traps

## Adaptive Depth Levels

Not every task needs the same depth of planning, testing, or documentation. Calibrate effort to the actual problem.

| Depth | When to Use | What It Means |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Minimal** | Single-file fix, clear requirement, trivial change | Write code, run existing tests, done |
| **Standard** | Multi-file change, some ambiguity, moderate complexity | Plan first, write tests, verify contracts |
| **Comprehensive** | Architecture change, high risk, cross-service impact | Full plan approval, ADR, integration tests, security review |

### Factors That Push Depth Up

- Request is vague or uses undefined terms → +1 level
- Change touches shared utilities or interfaces → +1 level
- Risk of data loss or security impact → jump to Comprehensive
- Multiple components or services affected → +1 level

### Factors That Keep Depth Low

- Human has given very specific, detailed instructions
- Change is isolated to one file with no shared contracts
- Existing tests already cover the area

**Default:** Start at Minimal. Escalate only when a factor above applies. Do not gold-plate simple requests.

## Cost and Context Awareness

Every tool call, agent dispatch, and file read consumes tokens. Be deliberate.

### Model Selection for Sub-Agents

The Task tool accepts a `model` parameter. Use it:

| Model | When to Use | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **haiku** | Quick, straightforward tasks with clear instructions | File search, simple grep, formatting, linting check |
| **sonnet** | Default — most implementation and review tasks | Code generation, code review, test writing |
| **opus** | Deep reasoning, complex architecture, ambiguous requirements | Architecture design, multi-system debugging, nuanced trade-off analysis |

**Default:** Inherit parent model (omit param). Only override when the task is clearly simpler or harder than the current model warrants.

### Foreground vs Background Agents

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Foreground** (default) | You need the result before proceeding — research, analysis, blocking question |
| **Background** | Genuinely independent work — linting, test runs, reviews while you implement |

**Rule:** Do not run agents in background just to appear fast. If you need the result to decide your next step, run in foreground.

### Context Window Management

The context window is finite. Protect it:

- **Read selectively.** Use `offset`/`limit` on large files instead of reading the entire file. Read the section you need.
- **Don't re-read files** you already have in context unless they were modified since your last read.
- **Summarize at boundaries.** When a task spans many steps, summarize completed work before continuing — this is cheaper than re-reading everything.
- **Prefer Grep/Glob over exploratory reads.** Find the exact file:line first, then read a narrow range.
- **Don't load blackbox/session-log.md** or other append-only logs into context unless explicitly asked.

#### Optimization Target: Tokens-per-Task, Not Tokens-per-Request

The correct metric is **tokens-per-task** — total tokens consumed from task start to completion, including re-fetching costs. Aggressive compression that loses a file path or decision forces the agent to re-read files and re-explore approaches, wasting more tokens than were saved. When deciding what to compress, preserve file paths, function names, error messages, and decisions — these are the most expensive to re-fetch.

#### Degradation Threshold (This Workspace: Sonnet 4.6)

This workspace runs `claude-sonnet-4-6` with a **1M token context window** (GA as of 2026-03-13, no long-context premium). Context compaction is also available — the API automatically summarizes earlier conversation when the window approaches its limit, enabling effectively unbounded sessions.

Despite the large window, degradation still occurs well before the limit. Degradation is a function of attention mechanics, not window size. **Begin active compression at ~700–800K tokens** (70–80% of 1M) — this matches the empirically validated 70–80% trigger point regardless of model generation. Signs of onset: repeating earlier steps, forgetting which files were modified, losing track of decisions made.

Known degradation patterns to watch for:
- **Lost-in-middle**: Information in the center of context gets ~10–40% lower recall than content at the start or end. Place critical constraints and the current task at the top; put supporting detail in the middle.
- **Context poisoning**: A hallucination or wrong output that enters context gets reinforced on every subsequent turn. If outputs start diverging from what was agreed, treat context as potentially poisoned — summarize from scratch using only verified information.
- **Context distraction**: Irrelevant files or tool outputs in context reduce performance even if they're clearly not relevant. Even a single irrelevant document degrades recall. Trim aggressively.

#### Structured Summary Template (use before `/compact` or at ~700K tokens)

Structure forces preservation — each section is a checklist the summarizer must populate, preventing silent loss of file paths or decisions (`context-compression/SKILL.md:29`).

```markdown
## Session Intent
[What the user is trying to accomplish — one sentence]

## Files Modified
- [file path]: [what changed and why]
- [file path]: [what changed and why]

## Decisions Made
- [decision]: [reason]
- [decision]: [reason]

## Current State
- [tests: N passing, N failing]
- [what is working, what is not]

## Next Steps
1. [immediate next action]
2. [follow-on action]
```

**When to use:** Before `/compact`, before handing off to a sub-agent, or at ~700K tokens in a multi-step session. With 1M context and automatic compaction available, manual compression is rarely needed — but when it is triggered (manually or by compaction), this template ensures the right information survives. Everything not in these sections can be lost.

### When to Break Tasks vs Do In-Session

```
Can I finish this in one session without losing context?
    |
    +-- YES (< ~15 files touched, clear scope) -> Do it yourself
    |
    +-- NO -> Break into subtasks:
        +-- Independent subtasks? -> Dispatch parallel background agents
        +-- Sequential subtasks? -> Complete each, summarize, continue
        +-- Too large even for subtasks? -> Stop. Ask human to scope down.
```

## Large Task Management

When a task is too large for a single context window:

- Break into self-contained subtasks with clear inputs/outputs
- Complete and verify each subtask before moving to the next
- Summarize completed work at each boundary for context carry-forward
- If losing track of earlier decisions, say so and request a recap

## Sub-Agent Governance

Sub-agents (via Task tool or Agent Teams) are powerful but have blind spots. Govern them.

### When to Use Sub-Agents vs Do It Yourself

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Single-file change, clear requirement | Do it yourself |
| Multi-file change within one domain | Do it yourself |
| 3+ tasks with an approved plan file | Use SDD pipeline (`subagent-driven-development` skill) |
| Parallel independent work streams | Use Agent Teams (TeamCreate) |
| Specialized review (security, DB, a11y) | Dispatch reviewer agent |

**Default:** Do it yourself. Sub-agents add coordination overhead — only use when parallelism or specialization justifies it.

### Mandatory Pre-Dispatch Checklist

Before dispatching ANY agent (Task tool or TeamCreate):

1. **Load the skill first.** The `subagent-driven-development` skill defines the Implementer -> Spec Reviewer -> Quality Reviewer pipeline. Skipping it means skipping review stages.
2. **Pass explicit context.** Agents do NOT inherit: `CLAUDE.md`, `lessons.md`, rules files, or conversation history. For Task tool: include everything in the `prompt` param. For Teams: include in the initial `SendMessage` body.
3. **Specify the subagent_type.** Match the agent to the work — read-only agents (Explore, Plan) cannot edit files. Do not assign implementation to research agents.
4. **Set isolation when needed.** Use `isolation: "worktree"` for changes that might conflict with concurrent work.

### Mode-Specific Rules

| Concern | Task Tool (sub-agent) | Agent Teams (TeamCreate) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Context delivery | `prompt` parameter | `SendMessage` body — never say "read the plan" |
| Coordination | You manage sequentially | Shared `TaskList` + `SendMessage` between teammates |
| Task assignment | One task per dispatch | `TaskUpdate` with `owner` field |
| Shutdown | Agent returns automatically | You MUST send `shutdown_request` to each teammate, then `TeamDelete` |
| Idle teammates | N/A | Normal — idle means waiting for input, not broken. Send a message to wake them |

### Limitations (Both Modes)

- Agents cannot read `.claude/rules/` or `CLAUDE.md` unless you paste the relevant rules into the prompt or message
- Agents create `.claude/agent-memory/` files that are NOT reliably read by future agents — treat these as orphans and consolidate via `/promote-lessons`
- Agents do not see prior conversation context unless the agent type description says "access to current context"
- Agent output is not visible to the user — you must summarize results back
- Team teammates cannot hear you unless you use `SendMessage` — plain text output is invisible to them

### Orphan Prevention

After any session using sub-agents or teams:

1. Check for `.claude/agent-memory/` files
2. Consolidate useful findings into `lessons.md` or skill reference files
3. Delete the orphaned files

This is automated by the `/promote-lessons` command and the stop hook reminder.

## Autonomy Ladder for Bug Fixing

Not every problem requires the same level of human involvement. Match autonomy to signal clarity.

| Signal Clarity | Autonomy Level | Action |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Clear** — failing test with stack trace, lint error with file:line, CI failure with log output | **Act first** — fix it, run tests, report what you did | Don't ask "should I fix this?" — just fix it and show the diff |
| **Moderate** — bug report with reproduction steps, error log pointing to a region of code | **Investigate first, then fix** — root-cause via `systematic-debugging` skill, propose fix, implement | Ask only if multiple valid fixes exist |
| **Ambiguous** — vague report ("it's slow"), no reproduction, unclear scope | **Ask first** — clarify scope and expected behavior before touching code | Overconfidence Prevention rules apply (core-behaviors.md §10) |

**Bias:** When the signal is clear (test output, stack trace, error log), act. When the signal is ambiguous, ask. The goal is zero context-switching for the human on well-defined problems.

**Constraint:** Even at "Act first" level, all existing guardrails apply — scope discipline (touch only what's broken), run tests after fixing, report with evidence.

## Error Recovery

When a task goes wrong mid-execution, follow this protocol instead of pushing forward or starting over silently.

### Partial Completion

If you completed steps 1-3 of a 5-step plan and step 4 fails:

```
STOPPED at: [step 4 — describe what failed]
Completed: [steps 1-3 — list what was done]
Options:
A) Retry step 4 with a different approach: [describe alternative]
B) Skip step 4 and continue with step 5 (with known gap)
C) Roll back steps 1-3 and start fresh
→ Which do you prefer?
```

Never silently skip a failed step and claim the task is done.

### Conflicting Requirements

If you discover a conflict between what was asked and what the codebase allows:

```
CONFLICT FOUND:
- Requested: [what human asked for]
- Constraint: [what the code/system requires — file:line evidence]
- Impact: [what breaks if we force it]
Options:
A) [Approach that honors the request, costs X]
B) [Approach that honors the constraint, delivers Y instead]
→ Which takes precedence?
```

### Missing Context

If you cannot complete a task because a file, API, or dependency is unavailable:

```
BLOCKED: Cannot proceed without [specific missing thing]
What I have: [list what is available]
What I need: [exactly what is missing and why]
Options:
A) Proceed with [assumption] — risk: [what breaks if wrong]
B) Stop here until [missing thing] is provided
```

### User Changes Direction Mid-Task

If the human redirects while a task is in progress:

1. Stop current work immediately
2. List what was completed (with file:line)
3. List what was NOT started yet
4. Confirm: should completed work be kept, modified, or reverted?
5. Only then start the new direction

### Error Severity Triage

Before deciding how to handle any error, classify it:

| Severity | Meaning | Response |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Critical** | Task cannot continue at all | Stop, report fully, list recovery options |
| **High** | Current approach is blocked, need alternative | Stop current approach, propose alternative |
| **Medium** | Can continue with workaround, quality reduced | Proceed with workaround, flag the gap explicitly |
| **Low** | Minor issue, non-blocking | Note it, continue, mention at end |

Never classify an error as Low when it hides a real problem.

### Change Request Decision Tree

When a user requests a change to ongoing or completed work:

```
User requests change
    |
    +-- Affects in-progress work?
    |   Yes -> Stop. List done (file:line). List not-started. Ask: keep / modify / revert?
    |
    +-- Affects a completed file or feature?
    |   Low impact (isolated) -> Inform and proceed
    |   High impact (cascading) -> List all affected areas, get explicit confirmation
    |
    +-- Affects architecture or structure?
        RED: List all cascading effects. Require explicit approval before changing.
```

**Before any destructive change:** commit or note the current state first so the human can roll back.
