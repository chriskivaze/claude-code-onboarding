- **vibe-code-auditor**: Pre-commit gate for AI-generated and rapidly-prototyped code. Audits across 7 dimensions — architecture, consistency, robustness, production risks, security, dead/hallucinated code (imports that don't exist, API mismatches), and technical debt. Produces a Production Readiness Score (0–100) with severity-bucketed findings. Use before `code-reviewer` when code was AI-assisted or evolved without deliberate architecture.

### Security (4 skills)
- **claude-actions-auditor**: Audits GitHub Actions workflows for Claude Code Action security vulnerabilities — detects 9 attack vectors (env var intermediary, direct injection, PR target misuse, dangerous sandbox configs, wildcard allowlists). Run before adding `anthropics/claude-code-action` to any workflow or during a CI/CD security review.
- **sast-configuration**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) configuration skill for setting up security scanning, configuring Semgrep rules, running SAST in CI/CD, or writing custom security rules.
- **security-reviewer**: Security vulnerability detection and remediation skill providing OWASP Top 10 checklists, secret scanning patterns, and security review methodology. Includes `owasp-infrastructure-baseline.md` (15 OWASP-mapped infra controls: encryption, IAM, network hardening, audit logging) for IaC and cloud config reviews. Includes `agent-guardrails-checklist.md` (12-layer AI agent guardrail pipeline: prompt injection defense, output validation, async audit logging, Constitutional AI) for LangGraph agents and agentic AI services.
- **threat-modeling**: Threat modeling skill for STRIDE analysis, attack tree construction, and security requirement extraction when designing new features or reviewing architecture.

### Workflow & Process (17 skills)
- **changelog-generator**: Used when preparing releases, writing app store updates, or maintaining a CHANGELOG.md by parsing conventional commits and outputting polished release notes.
- **documentation-generation**: Documentation generation skill for README creation, docstring patterns, and CI/CD doc pipelines when generating project documentation or creating README files.
- **domain-finder**: Used when starting a new project or brand and needing to find a registrable domain by brainstorming creative names and checking real availability via DNS/WHOIS.
- **plan-mode-review**: Structured plan review with Phase 0 self-review, 5-phase code review, approval scope triage, decision logging, and blast radius assessment for non-trivial changes.
- **receiving-code-review**: Used when receiving code review feedback before implementing any suggestion, requiring verification and technical rigor rather than performative agreement.
- **subagent-driven-development**: 3-role pipeline (Implementer -> Spec Reviewer -> Quality Reviewer) for plan-driven multi-task implementation supporting subagent dispatch and Agent Teams. Reference files: `parallel-dispatch-checklist.md` (independence check + conflict detection before/after parallel dispatch), `implementer-prompt.md`, `spec-reviewer-prompt.md`.
- **verification-before-completion**: Used when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, requiring verification commands and confirmed output before any success claims.
- **writing-skills**: Used when creating a new Claude Code skill from scratch, extending an existing skill, or reviewing a skill for structure compliance.
- **the-fool**: Challenge ideas, plans, and decisions using structured adversarial reasoning — devil's advocate, pre-mortem, red team, Socratic questioning, and evidence falsification.
- **feature-forge**: Used when defining new features, gathering requirements, or writing specifications before implementation starts. Runs PM+Dev dual-perspective interview, produces EARS-format functional requirements and Given/When/Then acceptance criteria saved to `specs/{feature}.spec.md`. Reference files: `references/nfr-checklist.md` (structured NFR elicitation — performance, scalability, availability, security, observability, compliance; load during Phase 2/3 of any feature with >100 users, an API, or compliance requirements), `references/interview-questions.md`, `references/ears-syntax.md`, `references/acceptance-criteria.md`, `references/pre-discovery-subagents.md`.
- **brainstorm** (`/brainstorm`): Divergent exploration before committing to an approach — generates ≥3 distinct alternatives with trade-offs and Mermaid diagram. No code; use before feature-forge or architecture-design when the solution space is still open.
- **new-project** (`/new-project`): Single entry point for starting any new project — detects tech stack from natural language description and routes to the correct scaffold command. Supports all 9 workspace stacks. Flutter requests automatically load mobile-design + flutter-mobile skills.
- **debug** (`/debug`): Slash command entry point for systematic-debugging skill. Enforces root-cause-first investigation with structured Symptom → Root Cause → Fix → Prevention output format.
- **audit-skills** (`/audit-skills`): Periodic health audit of all 61 skills — checks Iron Law, `last-reviewed` staleness (90/180-day thresholds), description quality, `allowed-tools` declaration, and body line count. Outputs aggregate PASS/WARN/FAIL report with recommended actions. Run monthly or after adding multiple skills.
- **iterate-pr**: Autonomous PR completion loop — fetches CI failures and review feedback, fixes and pushes until all checks are green. Classifies feedback by LOGAF scale (high/medium auto-fix, low asks user), polls CI, and posts GitHub thread replies.
- **multi-agent-brainstorming**: Structured design review using 5 constrained sequential roles (Primary Designer, Skeptic, Constraint Guardian, User Advocate, Arbiter) to validate designs before implementation. Produces mandatory Decision Log and APPROVED/REVISE/REJECT verdict. Use after `/brainstorm` and before `/plan-review` for high-stakes or irreversible decisions. Reference files: `agent-role-scripts.md`, `decision-log-template.md`, `exit-criteria-checklist.md`.
- **parallel-agents**: Multi-agent orchestration for Claude Code's native Agent tool — coordinates this workspace's 42 actual agents across 6 orchestration patterns (comprehensive review, pre-deploy audit, Flutter feature, agentic AI review, DB schema review, architecture validation). Includes workspace agent catalog and synthesis protocol. Reference files: `workspace-agent-catalog.md`, `orchestration-patterns.md`, `synthesis-protocol.md`.
