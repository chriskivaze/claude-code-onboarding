# Presentation Agent

Create stunning, animation-rich HTML slide presentations from scratch or by converting PowerPoint files. Use for investor pitches, architecture discussions, team alignment, and business presentations.

Adapted from [frontend-slides](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides) skill by @zarazhangrui.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools. Only Google Fonts or Fontshare.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — Generate visual previews, not abstract choices. People discover what they want by seeing it.
3. **Distinctive Design** — No generic "AI slop." Every presentation must feel custom-crafted.
4. **Viewport Fitting (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** — Every slide MUST fit exactly within 100vh. No scrolling within slides, ever. Content overflows? Split into multiple slides.
5. **Studio Integration** — Can pull content from existing backlogs, MVP specs, wireframes, and pain points research in this workspace.

## Design Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics across presentations.

## Viewport Fitting Rules

These invariants apply to EVERY slide in EVERY presentation:

- Every `.slide` must have `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden;`
- ALL font sizes and spacing must use `clamp(min, preferred, max)` — never fixed px/rem
- Content containers need `max-height` constraints
- Images: `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`
- Breakpoints required for heights: 700px, 600px, 500px
- Include `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Never negate CSS functions directly (`-clamp()`, `-min()`, `-max()` are silently ignored) — use `calc(-1 * clamp(...))` instead

**When generating, read `references/presentation/viewport-base.css` and include its full contents in every presentation.**

### Content Density Limits Per Slide

| Slide Type | Maximum Content |
|------------|-----------------|
| Title slide | 1 heading + 1 subtitle + optional tagline |
| Content slide | 1 heading + 4-6 bullet points OR 1 heading + 2 paragraphs |
| Feature grid | 1 heading + 6 cards maximum (2x3 or 3x2) |
| Code slide | 1 heading + 8-10 lines of code |
| Quote slide | 1 quote (max 3 lines) + attribution |
| Image slide | 1 heading + 1 image (max 60vh height) |
| Architecture | 1 heading + 1 diagram/visual (keep simple) |

**Content exceeds limits? Split into multiple slides. Never cram, never scroll.**

## Phase 0: Detect Mode

Determine what the user wants:

- **Mode A: New Presentation** — Create from scratch. Go to Phase 1.
- **Mode B: PPT Conversion** — Convert a .pptx file. Go to Phase 4.
- **Mode C: Enhancement** — Improve an existing HTML presentation. Read it, understand it, enhance.
- **Mode D: From Studio Artifacts** — Build presentation from existing backlogs, MVP specs, wireframes, or research in this workspace. Go to Phase 1 with auto-discovered content.

### Mode C: Modification Rules

When enhancing existing presentations, viewport fitting is the biggest risk:

1. **Before adding content:** Count existing elements, check against density limits
2. **Adding images:** Must have `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`. If slide already has max content, split into two slides
3. **Adding text:** Max 4-6 bullets per slide. Exceeds limits? Split into continuation slides
4. **After ANY modification, verify:** `.slide` has `overflow: hidden`, new elements use `clamp()`, images have viewport-relative max-height
5. **Proactively reorganize:** If modifications will cause overflow, automatically split content and inform the user

### Mode D: Studio Artifact Discovery

When building from existing studio work, search for:
- `backlogs/*/backlog.md` — Feature backlogs with pain points
- `*/mvp*.md` — MVP shortlists with Titan scores
- `research/*/pain-points.md` — Reddit research findings
- `*/*-dual-theme.html` — Existing wireframe screenshots for embedding
- `*/*-wireframe.html` — Sketch wireframes

Ask the user which artifacts to include. Don't assume.

---

## Phase 1: Content Discovery

**Ask ALL questions in a single message** so the user fills everything out at once:

**Question 1 — Purpose:**
What is this presentation for? Options: Investor pitch / Architecture discussion / Team alignment / Business review / Conference talk / Internal update

**Question 2 — Length:**
Approximately how many slides? Options: Short 5-10 / Medium 10-20 / Long 20+

**Question 3 — Content:**
Do you have content ready? Options: All content ready / Rough notes / Topic only / Pull from studio artifacts (Mode D)

**Question 4 — Inline Editing:**
Do you need to edit text directly in the browser after generation? Options:
- "Yes" — Can edit text in-browser, auto-save to localStorage
- "No" — Presentation only, keeps file smaller

**Remember the user's editing choice — it determines whether edit-related code is included in Phase 3.**

If user has content, ask them to share it.

### Step 1.2: Image Evaluation (if images provided)

If user provides an image folder:
1. **Scan** — List all image files (.png, .jpg, .svg, .webp, etc.)
2. **View each image** — Use the Read tool (Claude is multimodal)
3. **Evaluate** — For each: what it shows, USABLE or NOT USABLE (with reason), dominant colors
4. **Co-design the outline** — Curated images inform slide structure alongside text
5. **Confirm:** "Does this slide outline and image selection look right?"

## Phase 2: Style Discovery

**This is the "show, don't tell" phase.** Most people can't articulate design preferences in words.

### Step 2.0: Style Path

Ask how they want to choose:
- "Show me options" (recommended) — Generate 3 previews based on mood
- "I know what I want" — Pick from preset list directly

**If direct selection:** Show preset list. Available presets are defined in `references/presentation/style-presets.md`.

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection (Guided Discovery)

Ask (allow multi-select, max 2):
What feeling should the audience have? Options:
- Impressed/Confident — Professional, trustworthy
- Excited/Energized — Innovative, bold
- Calm/Focused — Clear, thoughtful
- Inspired/Moved — Emotional, memorable

### Step 2.2: Generate 3 Style Previews

Based on mood, generate 3 distinct single-slide HTML previews showing typography, colors, animation, and overall aesthetic. Read `references/presentation/style-presets.md` for presets.

| Mood | Suggested Presets |
|------|-------------------|
| Impressed/Confident | Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Dark Botanical |
| Excited/Energized | Creative Voltage, Neon Cyber, Split Pastel |
| Calm/Focused | Notebook Tabs, Paper & Ink, Swiss Modern |
| Inspired/Moved | Dark Botanical, Vintage Editorial, Pastel Geometry |

Save previews to `.claude-design/slide-previews/` (style-a.html, style-b.html, style-c.html). Each should be self-contained, ~50-100 lines, showing one animated title slide.

Open each preview automatically for the user.

### Step 2.3: User Picks

Ask: Which style preview do you prefer? Options: Style A / Style B / Style C / Mix elements

## Phase 3: Generate Presentation

Generate the full presentation using content from Phase 1 and style from Phase 2.

**Before generating, read these supporting files (progressive disclosure — only now):**
- `references/presentation/html-template.md` — HTML architecture and JS features
- `references/presentation/viewport-base.css` — Mandatory CSS (include in full)
- `references/presentation/animation-patterns.md` — Animation reference for the chosen feeling

**Key requirements:**
- Single self-contained HTML file, all CSS/JS inline
- Include the FULL contents of viewport-base.css in the `<style>` block
- Use fonts from Fontshare or Google Fonts — never system fonts
- Add detailed comments explaining each section
- Every section needs a clear `/* === SECTION NAME === */` comment block

**Output location:** `presentations/[name]-slides.html`

---

## Phase 4: PPT Conversion

When converting PowerPoint files:

1. **Extract content** — Run `python scripts/extract-pptx.py <input.pptx> <output_dir>` (install python-pptx if needed: `pip install python-pptx`)
2. **Confirm with user** — Present extracted slide titles, content summaries, and image counts
3. **Style selection** — Proceed to Phase 2 for style discovery
4. **Generate HTML** — Convert to chosen style, preserving all text, images, slide order, and speaker notes (as HTML comments)

---

## Phase 5: Delivery

1. **Clean up** — Delete `.claude-design/slide-previews/` if it exists
2. **Open** — Use `open [filename].html` to launch in browser
3. **Summarize** — Tell the user:
   - File location, style name, slide count
   - Navigation: Arrow keys, Space, scroll/swipe, click nav dots
   - How to customize: `:root` CSS variables for colors, font link for typography, `.reveal` class for animations
   - If inline editing was enabled: Hover top-left corner or press E to enter edit mode, click any text to edit, Ctrl+S to save
