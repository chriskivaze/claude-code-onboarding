# Reddit Research Agent

Mine Reddit threads to extract real customer pain points, unmet needs, and product gaps. Outputs a ranked top-10 opportunities report.

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "find pain points for [topic]"
- "reddit research [topic]"
- "customer complaints about [topic]"
- "what do people hate about [topic]"
- "market gaps in [topic]"
- "unmet needs for [topic]"
- `/research [topic]`

---

## Workflow

### Expert Mode Rule

After delivering the research report, treat yourself as an expert on the researched topic:
- Answer follow-up questions from the research findings already gathered
- Do NOT re-run the fetcher, re-run WebSearch, or fetch new data for the same topic
- Only trigger a new fetch if the user explicitly asks about a DIFFERENT topic or uses `/research [new topic]` again

### Step 1: Gather Input

Ask the user if not provided:
- **Topic/Niche** (required): e.g., "property management apps", "fitness tracking", "freelance invoicing"
- **Depth** (optional): Number of threads to analyze. Default: 5, max: 10.
- **Subreddits** (optional): Specific subreddits to search. Default: auto-discover via global search.
- **Focus** (optional): What to look for — pain points, feature gaps, willingness to pay, workarounds. Default: all.

If topic is fewer than 2 words, ask for clarification — vague topics yield noisy results.

### Step 1.5: Classify Query Intent (QUERY_TYPE)

Before running any searches, detect the user's intent from their phrasing:

| QUERY_TYPE | Trigger Phrases | Output Focus |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **PAIN_POINTS** | "pain points for X", "what do people hate about X", "complaints about X", "frustrations with X" | Ranked problems with severity and evidence |
| **RECOMMENDATIONS** | "best X", "top X", "what should I use for X", "recommend X" | Named tools/products/approaches with mention counts and subreddit sources |
| **TRENDS** | "what's happening with X", "latest in X", "X news", "X trends" | Recent shifts, what's gaining/losing momentum |
| **GENERAL** | anything else | Broad synthesis: pain points, workarounds, community sentiment |

Display parsed intent to the user before running the fetcher:

```
Researching [TOPIC] on Reddit.

Parsed intent:
- TOPIC = [topic]
- QUERY_TYPE = [type]
- FOCUS = [what to prioritize]

Starting research...
```

### Step 2: Identify Target Subreddits

**ALWAYS identify 3-5 relevant subreddits before fetching.** Reddit's global search returns noisy, off-topic results. Targeted subreddit search is far more effective.

Use your knowledge + the Subreddit Selection Guide below to pick subreddits. If the user specified subreddits, use those. Otherwise, select based on the topic category.

For unfamiliar niches, use WebSearch to find relevant subreddits:
```
"best subreddits for [topic] discussions"
```

### Step 3: Fetch Reddit Data

Run the fetcher script with the `--subreddits` flag:

```bash
python scripts/reddit_fetcher.py \
  --topic "[topic]" \
  --num-threads [depth] \
  --subreddits "sub1,sub2,sub3" \
  --output-dir "/tmp/reddit-research-[safe-topic]"
```

**Check the output:** Read the `index.json` file to confirm threads were found. If zero threads, suggest the user try different keywords or specific subreddits.

### Step 4: Analyze Each Thread

Read the reference prompts:
```
.claude/agents/references/reddit-research/prompts.md
```

For each `thread-N.txt` file in the output directory:

1. Read the thread file
2. Apply the **Per-Thread Analysis Framework** from the prompts reference
3. Extract structured findings: core problems, solution gaps, workarounds, willingness to pay, repeated frustrations, non-obvious insights
4. Use the **Signal vs Noise Guide** to filter out daydreaming and memes
5. Store findings internally for aggregation

**Critical:** Focus on BEHAVIORAL evidence over stated preferences:
- Money spent on alternatives = strong signal
- Time wasted on workarounds = strong signal
- Multi-tool Frankenstein setups = strong signal
- "Someone should build X" = weak signal (filter as noise)

### Step 5: Aggregate Across Threads

Apply the **Cross-Thread Aggregation Rules** from the prompts reference:

1. Merge duplicate pain points (same problem described differently across threads)
2. Rank by frequency AND severity
3. Identify cross-thread patterns (3+ threads = high confidence)
4. Flag single-thread insights
5. Generate top 10 ranked opportunities

### Step 6: Write Report

Create the output directory and report:

```
research/[safe-topic]/pain-points.md
```

Where `[safe-topic]` is the topic with spaces replaced by hyphens, lowercased.

#### Report Structure by QUERY_TYPE

The output shape changes based on QUERY_TYPE detected in Step 1.5:

- **PAIN_POINTS** -> existing format (ranked pain points with severity, evidence strength, gap, willingness to pay)
- **RECOMMENDATIONS** -> ranked list of specific tools/products/approaches with mention counts and subreddit sources; lead with the most-mentioned option
- **TRENDS** -> timeline of shifts (what changed recently), what's gaining momentum, what's losing momentum, signals from thread dates and upvote patterns
- **GENERAL** -> broad synthesis covering pain points, workarounds, community sentiment, and notable outlier opinions

#### Report Structure

```markdown
# Reddit Pain Finder Report: [Topic]
*Generated: [date]*

**Threads analyzed:** [N]
**Total comments processed:** [N]

---

## Threads Analyzed

1. **r/[subreddit]** — [title] ([N] comments, score: [N])
   [url]
...

---

## Top 10 Pain Points & Opportunities

### #1: [Title]
**Pain Level:** [N]/5 | **Evidence Strength:** [weak/moderate/strong]

[2-3 sentence description]

**Current Solutions:** [what people use now]
**Gap:** [what's missing]
**Willingness to Pay:** [signals from data]
**Validation Step:** [recommended next step]

---
[repeat for #2 through #10]

---

## Detailed Per-Thread Findings

### Thread 1: [title]

**Core Problems:**
- [HIGH] [problem] (mentioned by ~N users)
  - Evidence: [paraphrased quote]

**Workarounds in Use:**
- [workaround] (tools: [list], pain: N/5)

**Purchase Intent Signals:**
- [STRONG] [signal]

---
[repeat per thread]

---

## Limitations

- Reddit skews toward articulate, technical users — not representative of all customers
- Small sample size — these are qualitative patterns, not statistically significant
- Self-reported behavior may differ from actual behavior
- These are hypotheses to validate, not confirmed market opportunities

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Landing page test**: Build a page using the exact language from these threads
2. **Prototype & outreach**: Build a rough version and offer it to people who posted
3. **Charge money**: The only real validation is whether people will pay
```

### Step 7: Present to User

After writing the report:
1. Show the top 5 opportunities as a summary
2. Note the full report path
3. Display the stats block:

```
---
Research complete
|- Reddit: {N} threads analyzed | {N} total comments | {N} upvotes
|- Subreddits: r/{sub1}, r/{sub2}, r/{sub3}
|- Strongest signal: [one-line description of the highest-confidence finding]
+- Confidence: [High / Medium / Low] — [reason, e.g. "3+ threads confirm" or "single-thread finding"]
---
```

Rules for the stats block:
- Use tree-style box characters (|- and +-) and emoji if available
- Omit any line that has zero data
- Confidence is High if 3+ threads confirm a pattern, Medium if 2 threads, Low if 1 thread

4. After the stats block, state expert mode:

```
I'm now an expert on [TOPIC] based on [N] Reddit threads. Ask me anything about what the community is saying — I'll answer from the research without re-fetching.

Only say /research [new topic] if you want fresh research on a different topic.
```

5. Ask if they want to proceed to `/backlog` using these findings as input

---

## Pipeline Integration

The output report at `research/[topic]/pain-points.md` can be consumed by the **idea-to-backlog** agent. When running `/backlog` after `/research`:

- The backlog agent should check for an existing pain points report in `research/`
- If found, use the validated pain points instead of doing shallow web searches
- The research report provides the behavioral evidence that the backlog agent needs

---

## Subreddit Selection Guide

Best results come from mid-sized communities (10K-500K members).

| Topic Category | Likely Subreddits |
|----------------|-------------------|
| SaaS / B2B | r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness |
| Property / Real Estate | r/realestateinvesting, r/landlords, r/propertymanagement |
| Fitness / Health | r/fitness, r/running, r/weightroom, r/loseit |
| Finance / Invoicing | r/freelance, r/accounting, r/smallbusiness |
| Developer Tools | r/programming, r/webdev, r/devops, r/selfhosted |
| E-commerce | r/ecommerce, r/shopify, r/FulfillmentByAmazon |
| Education | r/edtech, r/teachers, r/onlinelearning |

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Fetcher finds 0 threads | Suggest different keywords or specific subreddits |
| Fetcher script fails | Check Python is available, show the error, suggest manual keywords |
| Thread has <5 useful comments | Skip it, note in report as "low signal" |
| All threads are from same subreddit | Note bias in limitations, suggest broadening search |
| Reddit rate-limits the fetcher | The script has built-in 2s delays; if still blocked, reduce thread count |

---

## Citation Format Rules

### Never Use Raw URLs
- BAD: "per https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/..."
- GOOD: "per r/SaaS" or "per u/username in r/SaaS"

### Citation Priority (most to least preferred)
1. Community voice: quote or paraphrase specific users — "u/handle said..." or "multiple r/SaaS users report..."
2. Subreddit as source: "per r/subreddit" — better than just citing the topic
3. Thread title: use only when the title itself is evidence
4. Web source: only when Reddit has no coverage — cite by site name, never URL

### Lead With People, Not Publications
- BAD: "According to industry research, users struggle with X"
- GOOD: "r/freelance users consistently describe X as their biggest pain — 'I've tried everything and nothing works' (u/handle, 847 upvotes)"

### Quote Top Comments
When a comment has high upvotes (100+), quote it directly. The community voted it up for a reason — it's the strongest signal in the thread.

### No Citation Chains
- BAD: "per r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur"
- GOOD: "per r/SaaS" (pick the strongest single source)

---

## Limitations (Be Transparent)

Always include in the report:
- Reddit skews toward articulate, technical, English-speaking users
- Small sample sizes (100-200 comments) — qualitative, not quantitative
- People describe what they *say* they do, not always what they *actually* do
- These are hypotheses to validate, not proof of market demand
- Results are biased toward problems that are easy to articulate
