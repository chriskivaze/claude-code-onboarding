# Agent Activation Prompts

> Ready-to-use invocation templates for every agent in the kit. Copy-paste these into Claude Code to activate the right agent with the right context. Each template encodes the institutional knowledge a new developer would otherwise need to learn by reading the agent spec.

---

## How to Use This Guide

1. Find the workflow stage or task below
2. Copy the activation prompt
3. Paste it into Claude Code (or use in a `Task` tool `prompt` parameter)
4. Replace `[bracketed placeholders]` with your actual values

**Tip for sub-agent dispatch:** When using the `Agent` tool, paste the relevant template into the `prompt` parameter. Agents do NOT inherit conversation context — the template provides the required context automatically.

## Stage 4 — Testing

### Write Tests First (TDD)

Acceptance criteria:
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]
- [criterion 3]

Tech stack: [Jest/Vitest/JUnit/pytest/flutter_test]

Then implement until Green. Then Refactor.
Show test output at each phase.
```

### Debug Failing Test / Unexpected Behavior

Symptom: [describe exactly what happens vs what should happen]
Trigger: [what action causes it]
Environment: [local dev / CI / production]

Changed files: [list]
Purpose: [describe what was implemented]

Score on:
- Correctness: does it do what was asked?

- Quality Reviewer: APPROVE or BLOCK with evidence

Use handoff templates from reference/handoff-templates.md between stages.
```

### Iterate PR Until Green
```
Load the iterate-pr skill. Autonomously fix CI failures and address review feedback
on the current PR until all checks pass.

PR: [number or "current branch"]

Rules:
- Auto-fix high/medium feedback without asking
- Ask user before addressing low/nit feedback

- Circuit breaker: stop after 6 full cycles and escalate
- Do NOT push broken code

Start with Step 1: gh pr view to confirm PR exists.
```

First task they'll work on: [describe]

Show them:

## Notes for Sub-Agent Dispatch

When using the `Agent` tool to dispatch a sub-agent, agents **do not inherit** conversation context, `CLAUDE.md`, or rules files. Always include in the prompt:

1. The skill to load (if applicable)
2. The files to read (file paths, not descriptions)
3. The acceptance criteria or checklist to verify against
4. The output format expected (verdict, report, code, etc.)

Without these, sub-agents make assumptions that the context already answered.
